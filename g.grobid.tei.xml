<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>General discussion and outlook The immune system protects the host from a range of microorganisms and toxins, but must overcome several complicated problems in order to achieve this. Firstly, the host should be able to distinguish molecular structures present on a diversity of pathogens, a task which should encompass a large variety of environmental microorganisms.</p><p>Secondly, the ensuing response should be mediated within a relatively short period of time, particularly because of the rate of proliferation of organisms such as viruses and bacteria. However, although this response should be dynamic enough to eliminate the pathogen, it should not be so vigorous so as to damage host tissue. And finally, a system should be in place such that a mechanism of tolerance exists to prevent healthy tissues of the host from coming under attack</p><p>The course of evolution has moulded the host's response to invading organisms such that very many of the host's earliest solutions remain in place along with the most recent. As a result, the host's immune response can be said to consist of an innate immune system forming the core of host defenses, and an acquired or adaptive immune system. In this regard, the innate immune system has been evolving for a far longer period of time than the acquired immune system, and is therefore in certain respects, more complicated and refined.</p><p>The innate immune system comprises several independent lines of defense which function collectively to safeguard the integrity of the host. Quintessentially, the innate immune system is responsible for creating an environment in which host cells' survive and invading exogenous life forms do not. Such an inhospitable environment is aided by the secretion of various antimicrobial peptides by host cells, the function of which remains an integral part retained by the innate immune system to this day. In general, these peptides are encoded within the host's genome and with time, have become inducible rather than constitutively expressed. In vertebrates, the development of a system used to eradicate toxins produced by microbes or other organisms involved the secretion of pathogen-specific soluble receptors, or immunoglobulins. The importance for the generation of an adaptive immune response therefore plays an important role in the battle against organisms such as viruses and bacteria, pathogens once thought to fall within the domain of protective innate immunity. Nevertheless, the development of a protective adaptive immune response is critically dependent on the innate immune system. Here, the production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-l, IL-6, or IL-12 by cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells are essential for the generation of adaptive immunity, without which the adaptive immune system is severely weakened. Thus, the initiation of an innate immune response is essential to multicellular life on this planet, and effectively tailors the developing adaptive immune response. Indeed, several primitive organisms such as sub vertebrates are able to survive without an adaptive immune response. Furthermore, circumstances that generate innate immunodeficiency disorders are more life-threatening than those that produce adaptive immune impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">A brief history of Toll</head><p>Studies performed on embryonic patterning in Drosophila initially identified Toll as a component of the Dorsal group, the Dorsal group being a set of genes responsible for encoding mutually complementing participants in a signaling cassette required for the optimal dorsal-ventral polarization of fly embryos (Anderson et al., 1985 a ; Anderson et al., 1985 b ). The fact that Toll was a central component in this signaling cassette led Nusslein-Vollhardt and colleagues to the realization that Toll in fact encoded a plasma membrane receptor bearing specificity for a protein ligand called Spatzle (Morisato &amp;   Anderson, 1994; Schneider et al., 1994). Indeed, it was found that Spatzle encoded a novel protein, which upon proteolytic processing became active, thereby determining where Toll was active (Morisato &amp; Anderson, 1994). Thus, the identification of Toll was discovered in an area initially unrelated to the realm of immunity.</p><p>Despite the establishment of Toll as a regulator of early embryogenesis, it was not until the early 1990s that a link between the Toll pathway in Drosophila and the interleukin-l receptor (IL-IR)-NF-KB-signaling cascade in mammals was made <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Gay &amp; Keith, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Heguy et al., 1992)</ref>. In Drosophila, activation of the Toll pathway following contact with Spatzle propagated nuclear translocation of an NF-KB-like transcription factor via an intracellular signaling cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">(Letsou et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b383">Shelton et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grosshans et ai., 1994)</ref>. Here, the contact between the adaptor Tube and a serine kinase called Pelle resulted in the phosphorylation and degradation of the IKB orthologue Cactus <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Geisler et al., 1992)</ref>, an inhibitor of a transcription factor called Dorsal <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Ip et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Dorsal was then able to regulate maternal-effect genes involved in dorsoventral patterning <ref type="bibr" target="#b425">(Thisse et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b321">Pan et al., 1991)</ref>. In mammals, signaling via the IL-IR-NF-KB-cascade proceeds via a TollIIL-IR (TIR)-domain-containing transmembrane receptor, and it was this cytoplasmic domain that was found to have homology with Toll (Gay &amp; Keith, 1991).</p><p>At the time, it was known that in mammalian systems, IL-l could induce NF-KB translocation to the nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">(Nonaka et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Anisowicz et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bomsztyk et ai., 1991)</ref>. This fact spurred two groups of Drosophila geneticists to independently identify KB motifs in the promoter sequences of insect genes known to encode antimicrobial peptides <ref type="bibr">(Reichhart et ai., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rosetto et ai., 1995)</ref>, Thus, apart from its role in embryonic development, Toll was suspected to control the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the insect host. In 1996, the requirement for Toll to protect an adult Drosophila from an Aspergillus fumigatus infection was the first report to link the Toll pathway with the regulation of an antifungal response <ref type="bibr">(Lemaitre et ai., 1996)</ref>. Here, in response to <ref type="bibr">A. fumigatus</ref>, the production of an antifungal peptide called Drosomycin is dependent on the translocation of a reI family member called Dif, a homolog of Dorsal <ref type="bibr">(Rutschmann et ai., 2000)</ref>. As was observed for the developmental cascade (Geisler et   ai., 1992), Spatzle was also required for the activation of Toll in response to A. fumigatus <ref type="bibr">(Rutschmann et ai., 2000)</ref>. Therefore, a model was established in which Toll functioned to control the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides which in tum promoted studies aimed at linking activation of the Toll pathway and the cytokineinduced activation ofNF-KB.</p><p>In 1997, a human homologue of the Drosophila Toll termed human Toll (h-Toll)</p><p>was cloned and characterized <ref type="bibr">(Medzhitov et ai., 1997)</ref>, in so doing becoming the first was contact 1). As was seen for its Drosophila counterpart, h-Toll could stimulate the translocation ofNF-KB to the nucleus and induce the expression of genes coding for the inflammatory cytokines IL-l, IL-6 and IL-8. The subsequent molecular cloning of a class of human receptors in 1998 showed these proteins to have intra-and extracellular domains homologous to that of Drosophila Toll <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">(Rock et al., 1998)</ref>, indicating that these proteins could constitute an important component of immunity in humans.</p><p>It was at this point in time that a series of purely genetic approaches identified Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) as the mammalian protein required for recognition of LPS and transduction of the LPS signal across the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr">(Poltorak et ai., 1998a,b)</ref>.</p><p>Here, Poltorak and colleagues were able to show that mutations in the Tlr4 gene present in two strains of mice, namely C3H1HeJ and C57BLlI0ScCr, were responsible for their LPS hyporesponsiveness. Through the application of positional cloning methods, the mutation in C3HIHeJ mice was attributed to the replacement of a conserved proline residue in the TLR4 cytoplasmic domain with that of a histidine (Poltorak et al., 1998 b ), while the Tlr4 locus in C57BLIl OScCr mice was entirely deleted (Poltorak et al., 1998 b ;   Poltorak et al., 2000). By 1999, studies using gene-targeted mice in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of TLR4 were deleted, confirmed the results of Poltorak and colleagues showing that the induced Tlr4 mutation abolished responses to LPS <ref type="bibr">(Hoshino et ai., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, thirteen mammalian TLR paraloques have been indentified <ref type="bibr">(Beutler et ai., 2004)</ref>. These constitute 10 TLR proteins in humans and 12 in mice, all of which have been shown to function as recognition receptors for various protozoal <ref type="bibr">(Campos et ai., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scanga et ai., 2002)</ref>, bacterial (Poltorak et al., 1998 3  ; <ref type="bibr">Takeuchi et ai., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b451">Hayashi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b473">Zhang et al., 2004)</ref>, fungal <ref type="bibr">(Meier et ai., 2003)</ref> and viral <ref type="bibr">(Tabeta et ai., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Heil et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Diebold et al., 2004)</ref> ligands, thereby controlling various aspects of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The genetic approaches used by Poltorak and colleagues to identify the TLR involved in LPS hyporesponsiveness in mice spurred other labs to search for possible polymorphisms within the human Tlr4 gene. Indeed, TLR4 polymorphisms have been associated with endotoxin hyporesponsiveness in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Arbour et al., 2000)</ref>. Here, the TLR4 polymorphism was identified as an amino acid substitution, from aspartic acid to glycine at position 299 (D299G). Similar polymorphisms have subsequently been associated with predisposition towards septic shock resulting from gram-negative bacterial infections (Lorenz et al., 2002 a ), as well as an increased risk of premature birth (Lorenz et al.,   2002 b  ). Nevertheless, human TLR4 has been shown to be critical in the innate immune response to LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and the receptor has subsequently been shown to be involved in signaling in response to a broad range of exogenous and endogenous molecules (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). For example, several exogenous molecules that use TLR4 for signal transduction include the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (Kurt- <ref type="bibr">Jones et al., 2000)</ref>, the anti-tumour agent Taxol found in the Western yew Taxus brevi/olia <ref type="bibr">(Kawasaki et aI., 2000)</ref>, and an envelope protein found in a murine retrovirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">(Rassa et al., 2002)</ref>. A few endogenous ligands have been shown to signal via TLR4 (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>), although it is suspected that contaminating LPS was present in several of the protein preparations <ref type="bibr" target="#b444">(Vabulas et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Okamura et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smiley et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>This being said, although the principal TLR4 activator is LPS, some controversy exists as to whether LPS actually binds to TLR4.</p><p>Preliminary experiments which suggested that an additional molecule was required for TLR4-mediated LPS signaling were proposed by Shimazu et al. (1999) in which overexpression of TLR4 did not confer LPS responsiveness on human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This additional molecule was subsequently identified as MD-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b384">(Shimazu et al., 1999)</ref>, and conferred LPS responsiveness by physically associating with the extracellular domain of TLR4. It is now known that not only TLR4 and MD-2 are involved in LPS responsiveness, but it has been shown that CD14 and MD-2 function collectively to present LPS to TLR4 <ref type="bibr">(da Silva Correira et al., 2001)</ref>. This receptor complex not only functions for LPS signaling but is involved in the LPS-mimetic action 6 at <ref type="bibr">VV,,.u'v, au,-"a.</ref>:&gt; et to <ref type="bibr">'Ilr",,,,,,,,,, .. ,,,,</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Kawasaki et al., 2000)</ref>. Although Taxol bears no structural similarity to LPS, it possesses several LPS-like activites including signal induction mediated by the TLR4-MD2 complex (Kawasaki el al., 2000). Several reports have proposed that TLR2 is also involved in LPS signaling <ref type="bibr">(Kirschning et aI., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b468">Yang et al., 1998)</ref>, although it has been suggested that overexpression of TLR2 promotes certain cell lines to become sensitized to minor non-LPS contaminants in LPS preparations (Heine et aI., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 1999; Underhill et al., 1999 a ). Indeed, it was later shown that highly purified LPS does not activate cells in a TLR2-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Hirschfeld et al., 2000)</ref>, although the receptor is involved in responses towards a structural variant of LPS from Leptospira and Prophyromonas <ref type="bibr" target="#b451">(Werts et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Hirschfeld et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>TLR2 is however the prImary receptor involved in responses towards lipoproteins. The immunostimulating activities of lipoproteins can be attributed to the presence of lipoylated NH2 termini present in a variety of gram-negative and grampositive bacteria, as well as mycoplasmas. TLR2 mediates cellular responses to lipoproteins derived from Borrelia burgdorfei, Treponema palladium, M tuberculosis and Mycoplasma fermentans (Hirschfeld et al., 1999; Aliprantis et al., 1999; Brightbill et   al., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 2000 8   ), but is also involved in mediating responses to several infectious pathogens and their products (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). As can be seen in the table, these include whole mycobacteria, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan, whole Gram-positive bacteria, Treponema glycolipid, yeast cell walls, peptidoglycan (PGN) and the Trypanosoma cruzi glycophosphatidylinositol anchor <ref type="bibr">(Lien et ai., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoshimura et ai.~ 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwandner et aI., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Means et ai., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Flo et aI., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b318">Opitz et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Campos et ai., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>It was later discovered that TLR2 did not function independently in response to several ligands. Here, TLR2 ligand specificity and signal transducing ability was determined by heterodimeric interactions with TLRs such as TLRI and TLR6 <ref type="bibr">(Ozinsky et ai., 2000)</ref>. In this case, cytokine production by a macrophage cell line was dependent on the cytoplasmic portion of TLR2 functionally pairing with either TLRI or TLR6, while dimerization of the TLR2 cytoplasmic domain did not induce cytokine production.</p><p>This effect was however dependent on the stimulus used. The detection of Gram-positive bacteria, PGN and zymosan is mediated by cooperative signaling between TLR2 and TLR6, while TLR2 functioned independently or with a TLR other than TLR6 to detect bacterial lipopeptides <ref type="bibr">(Ozinsky et ai., 2000)</ref>  between 1LRI and TLR2 were shown to be required for ara-lipoarabinomannan-and tripalmitoyl cysteinyl lipopeptide-stimulated cytokine secretion from mononuclear cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">(Sandor et al., 2003)</ref>, as well as responses towards the outer-surface lipoprotein (OspA)</p><p>of Borrelia burgdorferi <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Alexopoulou et al., 2002)</ref>. Thus, although specific ligands activate cells in a TLR2-dependent manner, the formation of complexes consisting of additional 1LRs or helper proteins such as CD 14 enhance the signaling capacity of the cell.</p><p>The capacity of a few 1LRs such as 1LR2 and 4 to recognize a variety of ligands is not shared by all of the members of the mammalian TLR family. In the case ofTLR5, a 55-kD protein monomer obtained from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial flagella was identified as the only TLR5 ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b451">(Hayashi et al., 2001)</ref>. However, the uptake and translocation of flagellin by cells requires that the flagellin filaments undergo depolymerization before affording recognition by TLR5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b392">(Smith et al., 2003)</ref>. Specific ligand affinities can also be afforded to TLRs involved in the recognition of nucleic-acidlike structures (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). The first of the 1LRs found to recognize a nucleic acid structure was TLR9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Hemmi et al., 2000)</ref>. In these studies, TLR9-deficient mice were found to be non-responsive towards bacterial DNA. Here, 1LR9 was found to specifically recognize unrnethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial but not vertebrate DNA. As a result, the subsequent administration of CpG DNA is sufficient to protect against infections by intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania major and Listeria monocytogenes in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Elkins et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Krieg et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zimmermann et ai., 1998)</ref>. In terms of recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA produced by several viruses during their replicative cycle, induction of type 1 interferons (lFN-a and -~) is believed to be mediated in part by TLR3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Alexopoulou et al., 2001)</ref>. Studies showed that expression of human TLR3 in a dsRNAnonresponsive cell line induced NF -KB activation following stimulation with either dsRNA, or the synthetic dsRNA analogue polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)].</p><p>Furthermore, animals deficient in TLR3 showed reduced responses towards both dsRNA and poly(l:C) <ref type="bibr">(Alexopoulou et ai., 2001)</ref>, although some doubt exists as to whether TLR3 is actually involved in the direct recognition of dsRNA. This stems from the fact that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the principal cells in both human and mouse blood that produce type 1 interferon in response to viral challenges <ref type="bibr">(Siegal et ai., 1999</ref>; Asselin-was IS """LU"'"  <ref type="bibr">et al., 2001)</ref>, the problem being that TLR3 is not expressed in this cell type <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Kadowaki et al., 2001)</ref>. This would indicate that TLR3 is not the only receptor involved in the recognition of viral nuclear material. Indeed, it was later shown that the physiological ligand for TLR7 and TLR8 is in fact single-stranded RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Heil et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Diebold et al., 2004)</ref>, thereby linking virus recognition by plasmacytoid dendritic cells to IFN production.</p><p>Although TLR7 and TLR8 participate in the discrimination of nucleic-acid structures in viruses, there is evidence that they are also able to confer responsiveness towards several synthetic compounds <ref type="bibr">(Hemmi et aI., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">lurk et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heil et al., 2003)</ref>. The first synthetic agonist shown to activate a TLR was the antiviral agonist imidazoquinoline resiquimod (R-848; <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Hemmi et al., 2002)</ref>. Here, TLR7 was required for responsiveness towards imidazoquinoline R-848 in mice. At the same time however, another group showed that both TLR7 and TLR8 could independently mediate recognition of imidazoquinoline R-848 <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Jurk et al., 2002)</ref>, thereby suggesting a certain amount of redundancy among these receptors.

Individually, IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 were shown to be important components in the cellular response towards IL-1 and LPS (Kanakaraj et al.,   1998; Thomas et al., 1999; Swantek et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2002), although IRAK-4</p><p>proved to be the more essential component in the IL-1-and TLR4-dependent signaling pathways. Ultimately, the lRAK homologs promoted association with tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which then lead to the activation of the IKK complex (inhibitor of nuclear factor-xB (lxB)-kinase complex). The IKK complex in turn sequestered NF-xB in the cytoplasm resulting in dissociation and nuclear translocation ofNF-xB <ref type="bibr">(Akira &amp; Takeda, 2004</ref>). As a result, cells deficient in MyD88 are non-responsive towards ligands for TLRl, 2, 3, 4,5, 7 or 9 in terms ofTNF and IL-12 induction. <ref type="bibr">1.4.2</ref> The MyD88-independent signaling pathway There were however some inconsistencies in the notion that NF-xB activation was solely a result of MyD88-dependent signaling. This stemmed from experiments in which LPS was still capable of inducing NF-xB activation, albeit with delayed kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(Kawai et al., 1999)</ref>. This led to the conclusion that an additional signaling pathway must exist, even though MyD88 was shown to be important for LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines.

It was found that Mal participated in TLR4, but not TLR9 signaling, which suggested that it played a role in the LPS-induced NF-xB activation in MyD88-deficient cells. In these experiments, the addition of a cell-permeable TIRAP/Mal peptide abolished LPS-induced maturation in both wild-type and MyD88-deficient dendritic cells, indicating that TIRAP/Mal was involved in LPS-induced MyD88-independent signaling. Indeed, the generation of Mal/TIRAP deficient mice revealed a role for Mal/TIRAP in TLR4 signaling (Yamamoto   et al., 2002 a ), however, it was also evident that neither Mal nor MyD88 were required for the TLR3-dependent activation of interferon-inducible genes.</p><p>The MyD88-independent activation of interferon-inducible genes can therefore be attributed to the TLR3~ and TLR4-dependent activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3).

This being said, a search for compounds that can be used for the treatment of allergy has identified R-848, the TLR 7 and TLR8 agonist, as a potential candidate (Brugnolo et al., 2003). Here, the characteristic T H2 response associated with allergen-specific CD4+ lymphocytes was shifted to a protective T HI response, indicating that the use of imidazoquinolines could have beneficial effects in the treatment of allergic disorders. The TLR-dependent activation of a pathogen-specific immune response has also been linked to the development of autoimmunity. In this setting, potentially self-reactive T cells in the peripheral circulation are kept in check by regulatory T cells (T R cells). T R cells therefore have a dual function in that they suppress the inflammatory responses of activated T cells, but also maintain tolerance to self antigens. Here, IL-6 produced by DCs in response to TLR activation makes antigen-specific T cells refractory to suppression by T R cells, allowing a pathogen-specific immune response to be mounted (Pasare et al., 2003), but also relieves suppression of auto-reactive T cells.</p><p>The MRL-lpr murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis has supported a link between TLRs and autoimmune disease.

Complexes of IgG bound to nucleosomes activate B cells from mice that express RF, a phenomenon also seen in SLE patients who have auto-antibodies that recognize nuc1eosomes and DNA (Tan et al., 1989). The link to TLR signaling comes from the fact that B cells from mice expressing RF but deficient in MyD88 do not respond to anti-nucleosome IgGs (Leadbetter et al., 2002). More specifically, TLR9 has been implicated in this as the TLR9 antagonist S-ODN 2088 <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">(Leadbetter et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Lenert et al., 2001)</ref> inhibits B cell proliferation. Furthermore, stimulation of TLR9 with CpG oligonucleotides is shown to break tolerance in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis (Ichikawa et al., 2002), substantiating the role ofTLRs in breaking peripheral tolerance towards self-antigens.</p><p>Apart from potential TLR antagonists that can be used to ameliorate autoimmune responses, a more dangerous approach would be to use high doses of LPS as a tool to induce suppression of auto-reactive T cells by TR cells (Caramalho et al., 2003). In this model, excessive doses of LPS increase the immunosuppressive effects of T R cells, in so doing describing a potential mechanism used by the immune system to minimize potential systemic damage resulting from massive inflammation.

Results presented here show that MyD88, and by inference TLRs, are required by the host to control and aerogenic M tuberculosis infection. Individually, animals lacking TLR2 were more susceptible to an aerogenic mycobacterial infection than animals lacking either TLR4 or CD14. Here, TLR2-deficient animals were unable to clear systemic bacteria as well as wild-type controls, a result attributed to defective granulomatous responses in the lungs of TLR2deficient animals. Dissection of the TLR2 phenotype revealed that animals lacking this receptor developed pulmonary immunopathology during an M. tuberculosis infection, characterized by elevated levels of TNF, IFN-y and IL-12p40, as well as increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Data presented here indicates that TLR2 is required by macrophages to control a pulmonary M tuberculosis infection, and in its absence the host attempts to compensate for this deficiency by upregulating a Type 1 inflammatory response, ultimately resulting in immunopathology and chronic pneumonia.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b412">(Takeda et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b443">Underhill et al., 1999')</ref>.

The increase in lung mass at day 56 post-infection corresponded with the development of lung pathology in TLR2-deficient animals at the same time point (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.6f). The inflammatory lung pathology was not a result of lower pro inflammatory cytokines but was associated with increased amounts of both TNF and IL-12p40 in lung homogenates of TLR2-deficient animals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>Microbial ligands have been shown to activate various mammalian TLRs, facilitating the transcription of genes that activate the adaptive immune response, including cytokines and various co-stimulatory molecules (Takeda et al., 2003; Underhill et al., 1999 b ;   Takeuchi et al., 1999; Brightbill et aI., 1999; Stenger et al., 2002). Globally, animals deficient in the adaptor protein MyD88 have been used as a tool to evaluate the importance of TLR-signaling in the initiation of an innate immune response. In the context of a virulent M tuberculosis infection, the absence MyD88 results in an increased systemic mycobacterial infection which ultimately results in the host succumbing to the disease before congenic wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1). Collectively, this result has been confirmed by other groups investigating the in vivo contribution ofMyD88 towards an M tuberculosis infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">(Scanga et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Fremond et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sugawara et ai., 2003)</ref>, although the models used do differ individually. Results presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Scanga et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b394">Sugawara et al. (2003)</ref> reveal that the infectious dose, strain of M tuberculosis used, and genetic background of gene-deficient animals largely affect the experimental outcome. However, the results presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b394">Sugawara et al. (2003)</ref> suggested that the development of an adaptive immune response during an M tuberculosis infection was not entirely dependent on the presence of MyD88. This concept was proven by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Fremond et al. (2004)</ref> in which vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) conferred substantial protection to a virulent M tuberculosis infection despite the absence ofMyD88. The authors concluded that MyD88 is an essential component of an innate immune response against M tuberculoSis, but that the development of adaptive immunity can proceed in its absence.</p><p>Although the role of MyD88 in innate immunity following an M tuberculosis infection is largely associated with TLR-signaling, a role for IL-l and IL-18 signaling during infection should not be ignored. In this regard, both IL-l and IL-18 signal via MyD88 <ref type="bibr">(Adachi et aI., 1998)</ref> and in their absence, could partially account for the susceptibility of MyD88-deficient mice towards mycobacterial infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Juffermans et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b457">Yamada et al., 2000)</ref>.

Results presented here would argue that TLR2 is indeed required for optimal control of a virulent aerogenic M tubercuiosis infection. In an animal lacking TLR2, disease progression is associated with elevated mycobacterial numbers in the lungs as well as increased dissemination of bacilli into both the spleen and liver (Fig. 3.2 &amp; 3.4). Furthermore, these animals are unable to form mycobactericidal granulomas (Fig. <ref type="bibr">3.5 &amp; 3.6)</ref>, and succumb to the infection before wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.4).</p><p>Comparison of these results with other models investigating the in vivo role of TLR2 during mycobacterial infections indicates that TLR2-signaling is not redundant during disease progression.

The resulting NO produced by the macrophage is then required by the cell to kill intracellular bacilli, a process which is mediated by TLR2 (Thoma-Uszynski et <ref type="bibr">al., 2001)</ref>. The reduced expression of iNOS in the lungs of TLR2-deficient animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.7) along with lower levels of pulmonary NO (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.1) suggest that pulmonary macrophages produce less related nitrogen intermediates than wild-type controls and would therefore contain more mycobacterial bacilli (Fig.  <ref type="table">3</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 3.4</ref>).</p><p>An increased proinflammatory response has however been shown to be detrimental for the host.

In this study, the absence of IL-27 /WSX -1 resulted in increased production of the pro inflammatory cytokines TN"F and IL-12p40 as we]] as an increased pulmonary recruitment of activated CD4+ T cells.

In TLR2deficient animals an increased Ag-specific T-ce]] response was also mounted (Fig. <ref type="bibr">3.11)</ref>, which was unable to compensate for the defective macrophage effector functions due to the absence of TLR2. It remains to be determined whether the increased expression of MHC-IJ on pulmonary CDllc+ and Ly-6G+ could account for the elevated Ag-specific Tcell responses (Fig. <ref type="bibr">3.11)</ref>, particularly due to the fact that mycobacterial bacilli are able to regulate MHC-II Ag-processing via TLR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">(Noss et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">(Noss et al., &amp; 2002))</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The initial host response towards the extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei is characterized by the early release of inflammatory mediators associated with a Type 1 immune response. In this chapter, results argue that this inflammatory response is dependent on activation of the innate immune system mediated by the adaptor molecule MyD88. Here, MyD88-deficient macrophages are non-responsive towards both soluble variant-specific surface glycoprotein (sVSG) as well as membrane bound VSG (mNSG) purified from T. brucei. Infection of MyD88-deficient mice with either clonal or nonclonal stocks of T. brucei resulted in elevated levels of parasitemia. This was accompanied by reduced plasma IFN-gamma and TII..l"F levels during the initial stage of infection, followed by moderately lower VSG-specific IgG2a antibody titers during the chronic stages of infection. Analysis of several TLR-deficient mice revealed a partial requirement for TLR9 in the production of IFN-y and VSG-specific IgG2a antibody levels during T. brucei infections. The My D88-dependent induction of an inflammatory response was also associated with infection-induced pathology in that animals lacking MyD88 were less anemic than wild-type controls. These results implicate the mammalian TLR family and My D88 signaling in the innate immune recognition of T. brucei as well as infection-associated pathology. To date, several reports have investigated the role of TLRs in initiating an innate immune response against experimental parasitic infections including T. cruzi, L. major, P. berghei   and T. gondii <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Campos et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Debus et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adachi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scanga et aI., 2002)</ref>. Collectively, the MyD88-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines was shown in vitro as well as in vivo, thereby implicating the TLR protein family in the initial recognition event. More specifically, in vitro experiments using APC deficient in MyD88 showed that the adaptor molecule was required for the initial induction of IL-12 following stimulation with parasite antigen <ref type="bibr">(Scanga et ai., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Campos et aI., 2004)</ref>, while animals deficient in MyD88 were more susceptible to live infections when compared to wild-type controls (Muraille et al., 2003; Adachi et al., 2001). The majority of these models therefore indicated that the induction of inflammatory cytokines required the MyD88-dependent activation of an innate immune response, the absence of which resulted in susceptibility towards parasitic infection.</p><p>The induction of an early polarized variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)-specific Type 1 immune response following an African trypanosome infection is generally associated with overall host resistance (Schleifer et al., 1993; Mansfield, 1994; Schopf et   al., 1998; Magez et al., 2002). More specifically, control of a T. brucei infection at the level of parasitemia has been associated with the early induction of Type I cytokines such as TNF and IFN-y, as well as a VSG-specific B cell response (Cross et al., 1990; Borst et   ai., 1994; Hertz et al., 1998; Magez et ai., 1999). At the level of the macrophage, the production of TNF is the result of the combined activation by circulating s VSG released by the parasite due to stress, as well as membrane-bound VSG (mfVSG) that consists of the dimyristoylglycerol (DMG) lipid moiety of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ferguson et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Magez et al., 1998)</ref>. Individually, while sVSG induces macrophages to secrete TNF in an IFN-y-dependent manner, mfVSG can overactivate macrophages in an IFN-y-independent manner (Magez et al., 1998). The induction of both TNF and IFN-y are therefore critical cytokines required for the initial control of the disease, their absence being associated with a severely diminished capacity to control proliferation of the parasite <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Hertz et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magez et ai., 1999)</ref>. The production of TNF due to an infection is however also believed to be related to the severity of T brucei-induced pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">(Magez et al., 2002)</ref>. Here, TNF-induced pathology has been associated with anemia and inflammation of the brain in both the human and animal host <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">(Okomo-Assoumou et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Lucas et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Magez et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The requirement for MyD88 in mediating cellular inflammatory responses towards various parasitic antigens indicated that macrophage activation and TNF production by T brucei sVSG and mfVSG was dependent on MyD88-signaling. Results</p><p>presented here show that T bruce i-derived sVSG and mfVSG do indeed activate macrophages in a MyD88-dependent manner, and mice lacking the adaptor are unable to control either clonal or non-clonal T brucei infections. Dissection of this response indicated that macrophages required TLR9 to respond to T bruce i-derived genomic DNA, while TLR9 was found to partially mediate immune inflammatory responses during the later stages of infection. Although MyD88 is required by the host to effectively control a T brucei infection, activation of an inflammatory response via this adaptor protein was also associated with infection-induced anemia. Thus, while the host requires My D88 to control the development of parasitemia, this event is also responsible for infection-associated immunopathology.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Macrophages require MyD88 to respond optimally to sVSG and mjVSG</head><p>It has previously been shown that the glycosylinositolphosphate (GIP) moiety of sVSG is the main trypanosome-derived TNF-inducing component (Magez et aZ., 1998). However, the TNF-inducing capacity of sVSG required IFN-y priming, suggesting that in an in vivo setting, macrophage responsiveness towards sVSG occurs after an IFN-y pre stimulation event. Here, all s VSG macrophage stimulation experiments were performed using a concentration of protein no higher than 10 Ilg/ml, a dose corresponding to a trypanosome load of approximately 2x10 7 parasites during infection. To determine whether macrophage TNF responses towards sVSG might be mediated by TLRs, bone marrowderived macrophages deficient in the adaptor molecule MyD88 were stimulated with sVSG either in the presence or absence of IFN-y (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1 a)</ref>. Neither wild-type nor MyD88-deficient macrophages responded to sVSG in the absence of IFN-y. Upon pre stimulation with IFN-y, wild-type macrophages produced TNF in a dose-dependent manner while macrophages deficient in My D88 produced none. TNF production in response to LPS was reduced in MyD88-deficient macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1 a)</ref>, but not absent. sVSG fractions were free of endotoxin, indicating that TNF production was solely due to sVSG stimulation. The production of nitrite by wild-type macrophages in response to s VSG was dependent on IFN-y priming, but was reduced in MyD88-deficient macrophages (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.lb)</ref>. In contrast to TNF and nitrite, no IL-6 or IL-12p40 were detected in culture supernatants (Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">4</ref>.lc &amp; d), and pre stimulation with IFN-y did not induce macrophages to secrete IL-6 or IL-12p40 in response to sVSG. In general, macrophages were far less responsive towards sVSG than they were to LPS (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.1a-d)</ref>.</p><p>Here, cytokine production induced by } Ilg/ml LPS far exceeded that produced by 10 Ilg/ml sVSG.</p><p>In response to environmental stress, trypanosomes release their VSG via a VSG lipase <ref type="bibr">(Rolin et aI., 1996)</ref>.

Within this context, it has already been shown that mNSG can elicit a macrophage response and that this response is independent of IFN-y prestimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">(Magez et al., 1998)</ref>.

The development of anemia in laboratory mice following an experimental T brucei infection has been shown to be largely mediated by TNF <ref type="bibr">(Magez et ai., 2004)</ref>, the production of this cytokine being a consequence of macrophage activation by parasite-derived glycoproteins and GPI moieties. Results</p><p>presented here show that the induction of TNF following stimulation of macrophages with sVSG or mfVSG is MyD88-dependent (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.1)</ref>, and that animals deficient in MyD88 have lower systemic TNF levels during the first peak of infection than those observed for wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.3b</ref>). The development of anemia was therefore assessed in animals lacking MyD88 to determine whether the adaptor molecule had a role to play in infection-associated pathology. Wild-type animals infected with pleiomorphic AnTatl.l T brucei become progressively more anemic during the chronic stages of infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4)</ref>, with animals losing on average 47% of red blood cells compared to the first day of infection. Infection of animals deficient in TNF were considerably more resistant to the development of anemia (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4a)</ref>, and only lost 13% of red blood cells following cJearance of the first peak of parasitemia. Similarly, animals lacking MyD88 (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4b)</ref> or IFN-yRl (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4c</ref>) are also more resistant to infection-associated anemia, losing 17% and 15% of red blood cells during infection respectively. Therefore, the MyD88-dependent activation of an innate immune response following infection with T brucei results in the production of TNF and IFN-y (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.3a &amp; b)</ref>    </p></div>

Here, screening of several PRRfTLR-deficient animals revealed that neither CD14, TLRI, TLR2, the combination of both TLR2 and 4, nor TLR9 were required by the host to control the first peak of parasitemia following a clonal T. brucei infection (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.1). However, animals deficient in TLR9 developed elevated levels of parasitemia following clearance of the first peak of parasites (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.1),</p><p>indicating that TLR9 could be involved in parasitemia control post first-peak. Following the first wave of parasitemia, lysis of the parasite results in the release of several parasite components into the blood stream. Apart from s VSG and mfVSG that promote a macrophage response, it has been reported that DNA from T. brucei is not only mitogenic for B lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">(Shoda et al., 2001)</ref>, but induces macrophages to produce TNF, nitric oxide and IL-12p40 in the presence of IFN-y. Here, the extent of B cell proliferation and macrophage activation was associated with CG dinucleotide content, a feature associated with bacterial DNA and TLR9 responsiveness (Hemmi et al., 2000).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">It</formula><p>was therefore postulated that induction of an inflammatory response following a T. brucei infection might be mediated, in part, by TLR9-dependent macrophage activation. Indeed, when stimulated with T. brucei DNA, macrophages deficient in TLR9 produced less TNF (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5a</ref>), IL-6 (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5b</ref>), IL-12p40 (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5c</ref>) and nitrite (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5d</ref>) than their wildtype counterparts. Macrophages deficient in TLR9 were unresponsive towards CpG DNA (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5a-d)</ref>, but responded normally to stimulation with LPS. In general, macrophages were far less responsive towards T. brucei genomic DNA than they were to CpG DNA (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5a-d)</ref>, possibly due to the fact that the frequency of CG dinucleotides in T. brucei genomic DNA is only 3.9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">(Shoda et al., 2001)</ref>. These results suggest that macrophage responsiveness towards T. brucei DNA is mediated in part by TLR9. IFN-y is a critical factor in contributing to parasitemia control following first peak clearance (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.2a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Table 4.1)</ref>. Analysis of plasma IFN-y levels in TLR9-deficient mice showed reduced IFN-y levels during the second parasitemia peak (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.6c</ref>). Reduced plasma IFN-y levels coincided with clearance of the first peak of parasitemia at days 10-13 at a point where 10 8 parasites would release genomic DNA into circulation.

Seeing that the murine host required both TLR9 and MyD88 to control a clonal T. brucei infection, we sought to determine whether this was also true for a non-clonal metacyclic T. brucei infection. Using a tsetse fly as a vector, mice deficient in either TLR9 or MyD88 were infected with metacyclic AnTarLl T. brucei parasites (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7a</ref>). When compared to the clonal AnTatLI T. brucei infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.2a &amp; 4.6a</ref>), the non-clonal AnTarl.l T. brucei infection resulted in similar parasitemia profiles (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7a</ref>). Mice deficient in MyD88 were unable to control both first and second parasitemia peaks. Here, non-clonal parasitemia levels in MyD88-deficient animals reached 4x10 8 parasites/ml blood at day 20 post-infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7a)</ref>, as opposed to 2xl0 8 parasites/ml blood for the clonal infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.2a)</ref>. Additionally, all MyD88-deficient animals succumbed to non-clonal infection by day 20 post-infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7b)</ref>, while these animals survived for 40 days following a clonal infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.2b</ref>). Mice deficient in TLR9 controlled the first peak of parasitemia as well as wild-type controls, but were unable to effectively clear parasites following first peak parasitemia (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.6a</ref>). Both MyD88-and TLR9-deficient mice succumbed to the infection before their wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7b</ref>; p &lt; 0.002 &amp; p &lt; 0.005, respectively). In a similar set of experiments, animals lacking TNF displayed a profound loss in control of parasitemia (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7c)</ref>, and succumbed to infection before wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7d</ref>; P &lt; 0.005). The progression of parasitemia was also associated with the development of anemia (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7e-g)</ref>, and this at a rate similar to that observed for non-clonal T. brucei infections (Fig. 4.4). Here, animals lacking MyD88 showed a reduction in anemia during the first peak of infection (Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">4</ref>.7e), a result not observed in animals lacking TNF (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7g</ref>). The role of TNF in anemia could not be determined following clearance of the first peak of parasitemia as all TNF -deficient mice succumbed to the infection at this time-point (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.7d &amp; g)</ref>. Clearance of the first peak of parasitemia coincided with moderately reduced anemia in TLR9-deficient animals (Fig. 4.7e &amp; t). The results therefore demonstrate that MyD88, TNF and TLR9 contribute to the control of parasitemia following a non-clonal T. brucei infection, and that MyD88   There is a growing body of evidence which indicates that recognition of several parasitic infections leads to the MyD88-dependent activation of an innate immune response <ref type="bibr">(Campos et ai., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Debus et ai., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muraille et ai., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Adachi et ai., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Del Rio et ai., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scanga et ai., 2002)</ref>.

Thus, in these models, the activation of the MyD88 signaling pathway results in the early production of IFN-y and IL-12, both of which are essential components in host resistance against parasitic infections.</p><p>The cytokines TNF and IFN-y have been shown to be critical factors in determining the relative level of host resistance against the extracellular parasite T. brucei <ref type="bibr">(Hertz et ai., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magez et ai., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Namangala et ai., 2001)</ref>. Deficiencies in either of these cytokines have been associated with elevated levels of parasitemia and, in terms of IFN-y, shorter survival times. Results presented here link the initial production of TNF and IFN-y following a T. brucei infection to the MyD88-dependent activation of an innate immune response. The production of TNF by macrophages in response to either sVSG or mfVSG requires signaling via MyD88. Thus, the release of parasite antigen in the time period preceding the first peak of parasitemia stimulates macrophages to produce TNF, which in turn contributes to controlling the height of first-peak parasitemia. Lower systemic TNF levels present in mice lacking MyD88 is indicative of a failure by the host to respond to parasite antigens. However, the activation state of macrophages during infection may influence the ability of the host to respond to a Trypanosome infection <ref type="bibr">(Coller et ai., 2003)</ref>. Indeed, macrophage responsiveness towards T. brucei sVSG required IFN-y prestimulation, which suggests that direct sensitization of host T cells by T. brucei to produce IFN-y occurs before macrophages are fully responsive to sVSG <ref type="bibr">(Olsson et ai., 1993)</ref>. However, IL-12p40-mediated activation of the host T cell compartment does not appear to play a crucial role during a T. brucei infection as mice  <ref type="table">4</ref>.1). In addition, stimulation of macrophages with mfVSG did induce the production of IL-12p40, but this response was independent of MyD88-signaling. These results suggest that the induction of an IFN-y environment following a T. brucei infection is independent of the action of IL-12, as previously shown in experimental infection models using T. cruzi <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">(Muller et al., 2001)</ref>, L. monocytogenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Brombacher et al., 1999)</ref> and M tuberculosis <ref type="bibr">(Holscher et aI., 2001)</ref>, but that the induction of IFN-y requires signaling via MyD88.

The protease caspase-l is required for processing of IL-I p and IL-18 into their biologically active forms <ref type="bibr">(Fantuzzi et al., 1999)</ref>. Infection of mice deficient in either IL-IRI or caspase-l showed little or no differences in terms of parasitemia control when compared to wild-type animals (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.1), and although a role for MyD88 in IL-I and IL-18 signaling during infection cannot be excluded, the necessity for these cytokines appear to be minimal when compared to TNF and IFN-y. Therefore, we attribute the reduced early protective response observed in MyD88-deficient animals to defective Toll signaling.</p><p>However, deficiencies in several individual TLRs failed to reproduce the elevated parasitemia levels observed during first-peak parasitemia in MyD88-deficient animals (Table <ref type="table">4</ref> During this stage of infection, lyses of 10 8 parasites would release more nuclear material into circulation when compared to lyses of parasites before the first peak of infection.</p><p>Here, IL-12p40 produced by macrophages in response to T. brucei DNA could in turn induce IFN-y production by PBMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">(Shoda et al., 2001)</ref>, and could account for the reduced systemic IFN-y levels found in TLR9-deficient mice following clearance of the first peak of parasitemia.

Therefore, both s VSG and parasitic DNA released systemically during infection contribute to macrophage activation and the resulting inflammatory response.</p><p>The extent to which they contribute to macrophage activation and the inflammatory response could be more substantially addressed once a receptor for s VSG has been identified. This being said, attempts to identifY individual TLRs involved in the activation of a protective innate immune response against other parasitic infections have been inconclusive. In some cases, purified parasitic components such as T. cruzi-derived GPI anchor were shown to activate TLR2 from both mouse and human origin in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Campos et al., 2001)</ref>, although within an in vivo setting, mice deficient in this TLR do not display a severely reduced capacity to control a T. cruzi infection compared to mice I deficient in MyD88 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Campos et al., 2004)</ref>. Furthermore, in murine infection models using P. berghei, T. gondii and L. major, investigators have been unable to formally demonstrate that individual, or combinations of TLRs, are involved in innate recognition of the aforementioned parasites.</p><p>Although activation of an innate immune response is required to control a T.</p><p>brucei infection, uncontrolled growth of the parasite in the absence of MyD88 is not necessarily the causative agent for infection-associated pathology. In this regard, data indicates that the general inflammatory state induced by the infection results in pathologies such as meningoencephalitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">(Okomo-Assoumou et al., 1995)</ref> and anemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">(Magez et al., 1999)</ref>.

The exact mechanism linking TNF to the induction of anemia remains to be shown, but it has been postulated that the capacity of ThTF to modulate the activation, growth, and phagocytic potential of macrophages links this cytokine to RBC loss through erythrophagocytosis <ref type="bibr">(Branch et ai., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Collins et ai., 1992)</ref>. This finding is however complicated by the fact that the level of anemia is influenced by the background of the host (Magez et a <ref type="bibr">!., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taiwo et ai., 2000)</ref>, a result attributed to p75 TNF receptor shedding in a murine model as a means to prevent inflammatory pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Magez et al., 2004)</ref>. Results</p><p>presented here expand on the finding that the murine host is not only less anemic in the absence of TNF (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4a</ref>), but that the development of anemia can be linked to the MyD88-dependent activation of macrophages by parasite components such as sVSG and mfVSG (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.1 &amp; 4.4b</ref>). This not only holds true for clonal experimental T. brucei infections (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.4b</ref>), but for non-clonal metacyclic T. brucei infections as well (Fig.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.7e).</head><p>A lesser role in anemia can be attributed to the TLR9-dependent activation of macrophages by parasitic DNA (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.5)</ref>, which upon comparison to clonal and nonclonal infections in MyD88-deficient mice, effects an intermediary phenotype (Fig. <ref type="bibr">4.6f &amp; 4.7f</ref>). Therefore, the resulting MyD88-dependent activation of the innate immune system by parasite components serves to control parasite numbers, but in doing so contributes to the infection-associated pathology as well.</p><p>Collectively, it is likely that the induction of an innate Immune response following a T. brucei infection is mediated by interaction between several TLRs that signal via MyD88. Indeed, the requirement for the MyD88-dependent activation of an innate immune response is far more pronounced in non-clonal T. brucei infections. In the field, this would indicate that the VSG repertoire presented by the parasite is far greater, emphasizing the requirement for the TLR protein family in initiating an immune response. This being the case, a recent report has described a ligand for TLRll, a TLR initially found to confer protection against uropathogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b473">(Zhang et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Although in this paper the phenotype was resticted to the urogenital system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b470">Yarovinsky et al. (2005)</ref> show that TLR11 is also involved in the recognition of a protozoan profilinlike protein. Profilin homologs can be found in several apicomplexan parasites including T. gondii, P. falciparum, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Eimeria tene/la <ref type="bibr">(Yarovinsky et ai., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b357">Rosenberg et al., 2005)</ref>, and is also present in T. brucei <ref type="bibr">(Wilson et ai., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>However, it is feasible that recognition of T. brucei is not solely mediated by the TLR family, but could include pattern recognition receptors involved in recognizing sugar moieties within the variant surface glycoprotein. An example of this type of complex formation between the TLR protein family and proteins unrelated to the TLR family exists for recognition of endotoxin by the CD14-TLR4-MD2 complex (Miyake et al.,   2004; Akashi et ai., 2003). In the case of T. gondii, parasite-induced IL-12 production by DCs was found to be mediated by the dual interaction between My D88 and the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) (Scanga et ai., 2002; Aliberti et ai., 2000), indicating that TLRs function in concert with additional cell-surface receptors to effect the appropriate immune response. Analysis of the VSG coat covering T. brucei revealed that the galactose side chain composition appears to be important in terms of the TNF-inducing capacity of s VSG <ref type="bibr">(Magez et ai., 1998)</ref>. Thus, while the generation of a protective Type 1 immune response following a T. brucei infection is MyD88-dependent, it is likely that the initial recognition event is mediated by memberls of the TLR family functioning cooperatively with a surface protein/s involved in galactose recognition. The requirement for• TLRs in conferring protective immunity In insects and mICe suggested a central role for TLRs in the primary recognition of infectious pathogens LeMaitre et ai., 1996; Poltorak et aI., 1998 a ). An early hypothesis held that individual TLR recognized or sensed specific microbial molecules, such that collective TLR recognition would enable the host to detect most microbes. Initially, TLR ligand specificities were determined using overexpression studies, and although such studies revealed useful information about the functioning of signal transduction molecules (Takeda et ai., 2003), it was found that the results of these studies might in fact be misleading. For example, overexpression studies suggested that TLR2 played a role in LPS signaling <ref type="bibr">(Yang et ai., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kirschning et ai., 1998)</ref>, a result that was later attributed to cell lines becoming extremely sensitive to minor non-LPS contaminants in LPS preparations due to the overexpression of TLR2. The more recent advent of TLR knockout mice enabled a more thorough characterization of individual TLR ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Akira et al., 2001)</ref>. The results obtained from these studies suggested that the individual TLR-ligand specificities determined in vitro could be extrapolated to in vivo infectious models where the host would require TLRs to initiate an immune response. Collectively, the majority of infectious disease models investigating the contribution made by TLRsignaling in the initiation of immunity have done so using animals deficient in MyD88. In The requirement for individual TLRs in activating an innate immune response does appear to be proportional to the rate of proliferation of the pathogen. This statement is corroborated when comparing acute infections caused by bacteria and viruses to more chronic infections such as those caused by M tuberculosis and T brucei. For example, in acute bacterial and viral infections, individual TLR-deficiencies have been shown to severely compromise an innate immune response (Wang et al., 2004; Takeuchi et al.,   2000 c ; Echchannaoui et al., 2002). In these experimental systems, the rapid induction of inflammatory cytokines such as 1NF are essential in controlling these infections which indicates that the induction of an inflammatory response by individual TLRs is sufficient to control shorter more acute infections. However, when comparing these results to those obtained for more chronic infections such as those induced by M tuberculosis and T brucei, it appears that collective TLR-signaling is required to elicit a controlled inflammatory response. This was corroborated by the fact that animals lacking My D88 were unable to control either M tuberculosis or T. brucei infections. This being said, although collective TLR-signaling is required to control more chronic infections, work presented here also shows that specific TLR-signaling is not redundant in such infections.</p><p>It was shown that TLR2 contributed significantly to controlling mycobacterial growth in vivo, proving that this TLR is an important member of the TLR family in the context of mycobacterial infections. The same was seen for TLR9 and the importance of this TLR in controlling growth of the parasite during the more chronic stages of T. brucei infections.</p><p>Thus, there are members of the TLR protein family that have more prominent roles in the development of immunity during chronic infections, but it is their collective signaling that prevents progression to disease.</p><p>Activation of the immune response by various TLRs is however not solely dependent on the pathogen at hand, but appears to be modulated by the initial route of infection as well. In the case of M tuberculosis infections, several reports indicate that intraperitoneal as opposed to intravenous or aerogenic infection can severly compromise the resulting phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Heldwein et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Feng et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">Reiling et al., 2002)</ref> infections (Kropf et al., 2004; Adachi et al., 2001; Scanga et al., 2002; Alexopoulou et   al., 2002). Delineating the role of individual TLRs in activating an innate immune response is therefore made more complicated due to the use of different routes of infection, a fact which is more evident in shorter acute infections. For example, animals deficient in MyD88 were highly susceptible to an intravenous S. aureus infection (Takeuchi et al., 2000 C  ), but resistant to an aerogenic <ref type="bibr">S. aureus challenge (Skerret et al., 2004)</ref>. The authors ascribe this discrepancy to the MyD88-independent activation of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils which imparts a certain amount of tissue specificity towards staphylococcal infections. Secondly, models investigating the role of TLRs in the innate recognition of <ref type="bibr">S.</ref> pneumonia show that the control of an intranasal infection proceeds in a TLR2-independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">(Knapp et al., 2004)</ref>, with more protection conferred by TLR4 during both nasopharyngeal and intranasal routes of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">(Malley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Branger et al., 2004)</ref>. In contrast, pneumococcal meningitis induced by intracerebral injection of <ref type="bibr">S.</ref> pneumonia was shown to be TLR2dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Echchannaoui et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koedel et aI., 2003)</ref>, which suggests that the role of TLR2 in the host response towards S. pneumonia is dependent on the route of infection. Thirdly, in infectious studies using the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, activation of the immune response was shown to be independent of TLR4 <ref type="bibr">(Yauch et ai., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Biondo et al., 2005)</ref>, although significant differences were observed in the survival times of wild-type and TLR4-deficient animals infected intraperitoneally as opposed to intranasally <ref type="bibr" target="#b471">(Yauch et al., 2004)</ref>. These results therefore show that the initiation of an immune response is also dependent upon the site of infection, and that the requirement for individual TLRs in this response varies accordingly. Although this has been observed for the TLR -dependent activation of the immune system during acute infections, this system of immune activation should be taken into account for pathogens . that cause more chronic infections as welL In terms of the M tuberculosis model presented here, all infections were initiated by delivering the bacillus directly into the lungs, and all conclusions pertaining to the TLR-dependent activation of the immune response were based on an experimental set-up that closely reflects the natural route of infection. All experiments were performed using one strain of M tuberculosis, and although various mycobacterial strains have been to an S. aureus ,",LA'",LA <ref type="bibr">'."",,",</ref> manner more reSPOll1Se was shown to independent of TLR 4 were rlT"'l't,&gt;ri intraperitoneally</p><p>"""'P'T(' <ref type="bibr">'''''''</ref> show that the and that the accordingly.

Such uniformity could not be employed in the T brucei model as experiments used to investigate the lLRdependent activation of an immune response varied in terms of the parasite strain used, as well as the initial route of infection. The differences in progression of infection were apparent when comparing the clonal and non-clonal infections. Gene-deficient animals infected with non-clonal parasites had higher levels of parasitemia and succumbed to the infection before animals infected with clonal stabilates of the parasite. This would indicate that the non-clonal form transmitted by the tsetse fly is more virulent than the clonal form. However, mice infected with non-clonal parasites had the parasites delivered sub-cutaneously or intra-dermally by the fly, while the clonal infections were initiated intra-peritoneally. Therefore, in addition to the use of two strains of parasite, the initial route of infection with these strains does differ and may contribute to the TLR-dependent activation of an immune response. It remains to be determined whether sub-cutaneous as opposed to intra-peritoneal T brucei infections elicit a differentiallLR-response in terms of the route of infection. However, no differences were observed in terms of the role for TLR9 in either clonal or non-clonal infections in that the requirement for this TLR was restricted to the second peak of parasitemia, and argues that differing routes of infection have little or no effect on the requirement for TLR9 in this model.</p><p>The fact that activation of innate immunity is dependent on both the nature of the microbe and the site(s) of infection suggests the preferential activation of different cell types in a pathogen-and tissue-specific manner. A recent report describing the in vivo production of TNF by specific leukocyte subsets showed that local as opposed to systemic TNF production was not only dependent on different cellular subsets, but on the physiological location as well as the cellular stimulus used <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Grivennikov et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Here, in an intracellular bacterial model using  et al.,   2004). These results therefore suggest that T-cells are the major producers ofTNF during mycobacterial infections and that a defect at the level of the macrophage results in an upregulation of the host T-cell response during an M tuberculosis infection. In the model investigating innate mechanisms required to control the extracellular parasite T. brucei,   data presented here shows that macrophages require TLRs to produce TNF in response to parasite antigens. This inflammatory response is however restricted to the macrophage as it is macrophage-derived TNF and not T-cell-derived TNF that is responsible for control of parasitemia (unpublished observations). Therefore, control of parasitemia appears to be dependent on the production of TNF by macrophages and not T -cells, thereby more closely resembling the model of LPS/D-Gal-induced toxic shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Grivennikov et al., 2005)</ref>. Collectively, these results indicate that recognition of both M tuberculosis and T.</p><p>brucei is initially orchestrated by the macrophage, but that the major cellular producers of TNF are T -cells during mycobacterial infections and macrophages during T. brucei infections.</p><p>Although the induction of TNF is associated with a protective immune response in an infectious setting, the cytokine has been implicated in pathology associated with infectious and sterile inflammation, as well as several autoimmune diseases, in so doing This would not only apply to pathogens that cause acute infections, but should be taken into account for pathogens that cause more chronic infections as well.</p><p>The work presented in this thesis therefore shows that the mammalian host requires TLRs to recognize molecular structures present on M tuberculosis and T brucei.</p><p>Infection of the host with either pathogen showed that the innate immunological response initiated by TLR signaling regulated the adaptive immune response during the chronic stages of infection.

At the ltbvel of individual PRRs, in vitro studies implicated CD 14, TLR2 and TLR4 in innate recognition of mycobacterial bacilli. Upon mycobacterial infection, TLR2 is shown to have a more pronounced role during infection than either CD14 or TLR4, although both CD14 and TLR4 are likely to contribute to overall host resistance. Dissection of the TLR2 phenotype revealed that animals lacking this receptor developed pulmonary immunopathology during an M tuberculosis infection, characterized by inflamed lungs and an increased T-cell infiltrate. The lack of functional granulomas during the chronic stages of infection accompanied by chronic pneumonia resulted in TLR2-deficient animals succumbing to the infection.</figDesc></figure>

Animals aerogenically infected with 500 CFU M tuberculosis were therefore sacrificed at 4 weeks post-infection, following which spleens were removed. Restimulation of wild-type and TLR2-deficient splenocytes with either ConA or mycobacterial bacilli (Fig.3.lla), showed higher levels of IFN-y produced by TLR2-deficient cell cultures. This was observed for the Ag-specific bacillus stimulus as well as the non-specific mitogen ConA. To determine whether the increased IFN-y levels observed in TLR2-deficient splenocyte cultures was a result of increased T cell numbers, enriched T cell suspensions were prepared from infected mice and restimulated in vitro (Fig.3.l1b). Here, enriched CD3+ T cell suspensions were prepared from wild-type mediastinal lymph nodes on day 28 after infection with M tuberculosis by magnetic cell sorting. Enriched CD3+ T cells with a purity of &gt;95% were restimulated in vitro with Ag-pulsed wild-type or TLR2-deficient peritoneal macrophages, and IFN-y production was measured (Fig. 3.11 b). In the case of TLR2-deficient peritoneal macrophages pulsed with either PPD or viable M tuberculosis, the resulting restimulation of wild-type enriched CD3+ T cells produced more IFN-y than T cells restimulated by wild-type macrophages. This would indicate that TLR2 signaling might influence the outcome of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cell differentiation. Indeed, downregulation of cell surface molecules such as MHC-II by M tuberculosis might be a mechanism used by the bacillus to evade the host immune response.

Animals deficient in CDI4, TLR2 or TLR4 control a low-dose aerogenic M tuberculosis infection at 15 weeks post-infection, although a TLR2deficiency results in an increased systemic infection and poor granuloma formation by 22 weeks post-infection (Fig. 3.2 &amp; 3.5).

The increased recruitment of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the lungs of TLR2-deficient animals could be a result of the host attempting to compensate for the decreased effector functions of TLR2-deficient macrophages. Indeed, it has been shown that the addition of TNF and IFN-y to macrophage cell cultures effects killing of intracellular mycobacteria to the same extent as 19-kDa-induced TLR2-mediated activation (Thoma-Uszynski etal.,   2001), indicating that TNF, IFN-y and at least TLR2 work in concert to kill intracellular mycobacterial bacilli. However, in the absence of TLR2, increased amounts of TNF and IFN-y are unable to restore full macrophage effector functions as evident by the reduced 53 NO and increased bacillary burden present in TLR2-deficient mice (Table</figDesc></figure>

The balance between the use of these cell-surface receptors as a means to activate a proinflammatory innate immune response and potential mechanisms used by the bacillus to evade that response ultimately results in either protective immunity or chronic disease. Studies using individual PRRdeficient animals should therefore take into account the fact that much redundancy exists within recognition of mycobacterial components, and pronounced phenotypes in such models can depend on several factors. Although genetic background and strain of M. tuberculosis used can influence the experimental outcome, results presented here indicate that TLR2 plays a more prominent role during an M tuberculosis infection than</figDesc></figure>

Following clearance of the first peak of parasitemia, wild-type animals developed a reduced second peak of parasitemia at days 13-15 post-infection, and succumbed to the final lethal peak of parasitemia at approximately 40-50 days post-infection (Fig.4.2a).Animals deficient in either MyD88 or IFN-yRI had significantly elevated parasitemia levels post first-peak (Fig.4.2a), which remained elevated for the duration of the infection with both gene-deficient animals succumbing to infection before wild-type controls (Fig.4.2b;p &lt; 0.01 &amp; p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

Although the majority of TLRs signal via MyD88, some TLRs have also been shown to signal via MyD88-independent pathways (see introduction), both of which ultimately induce NF-KB activation. In the work presented here, the contribution of TLR signaHng towards the control of infectious diseases is assessed in the context of M tuberculosis and T. brucei, addressing the following questions: i) during an infection, is the requirement for individual TLRs influenced by the duration of the infection?, ii) do different routes of infection influence the TLR-an immune response?, and iii) is there a correlation between the TLR-dependent control of an infection and immunopathology?</figDesc></figure>

However, a role for T -cell-derived TNF became apparent once higher doses of L. monocytogenes were used, indicating that T -cell-derived TNF is required for protection against high that cannot be solely provided by innate mechanisms. In contrast to this, the deleterious role ofTNF in LPS/D-Gal-induced toxic shock was solely due to its production by macrophages and neutrophils, with no role for either B-or Tcell-derived TNF in this process. The corollary with the TLR-dependent activation of innate mechanisms becomes more apparent here. In the intracellular bacterial model using M tuberculosis, a deficiency in TLR2 impairs the capacity of the macrophage not only to produce TNF, but also to kill intracellular bacteria. Once the dose of bacteria is increased or uncontrolled due to the defective macrophage compartment, T -cell-derived TNF is a function used by the host to control the infection. This was evident in the M tuberculosis model where increased levels of pulmonary TNF were associated with an increased recruitment of activated T -cells. It remains to be formally demonstrated that macrophage-derived TNF plays a more prominent role during pulmonary M tuberculosis I infection as opposed to T -cell-derived TNF, although a pronounced role for T -cellderived TNF was recently shown in long-term mycobacterial infections (Saunders</figDesc></figure>

These strategies not only apply to the downregulation of TLR function in the context of pathologies such as sepsis and autoimmune disease, but also extend to the upregulation of TLR function in diseases such as cancer, allergy and disease epidemics.However, the specific targeting of innate immune pathways such as TLRs as a means to control pathologies induced by diseases such as autoimmunity and sterile inflammation should be approached with caution. Work presented here shows that manipulation of host TLR-signaling pathways can result in both uncontrolled disease progression as well as infection-induced immunopathology. In the model of M tuberculosis, deletion of TLR2 impaired the immune response such that the host attempted to compensate for this deficiency by upregulating an inflammatory response. The resulting pulmonary phenotype was one similar to that observed for sterile inflammation, namely tissue injury and an influx of immunologically active cells. In terms of the T brucei model, blocking TLR signaling certainly reduced the infection-associated anemia, but also resulted in the inability of the host to control growth of the parasite. Collectively, these results indicate that the blockade of TLR signaling as a means to quell pathologies such as those caused by sterile inflammation would ultimately endanger the host's ability to control infectious disease.</figDesc></figure>
